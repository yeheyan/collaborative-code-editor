# Collaborative Code Editor

> A real-time collaborative code editing platform inspired by Google Docs and Overleaf

## About This Project

This is my personal journey into building a **real-time collaborative code editor** from scratch. Think of it as a simplified fusion of Google Docs' collaboration features with a code editor's functionality - where multiple developers can write, edit, and debug code together in real-time.

### Why This Project?

As a developer eager to master full-stack engineering, I'm using this project as a comprehensive learning playground to explore:

- **Distributed Systems** - Understanding how to handle concurrent editing and conflict resolution
- **Microservices Architecture** - Building scalable, modular services
- **Real-time Networking** - Implementing WebSocket connections and live synchronization
- **Full-Stack Development** - From database design to responsive UI

## AI-Assisted Development

I'm leveraging modern AI tools to accelerate development while deepening my understanding:

- **Claude AI** - Architecture decisions and complex problem-solving
- **ChatGPT** - Code generation and debugging assistance  
- **GitHub Copilot** - Real-time coding suggestions

### My Approach to AI Coding

While AI tools are incredibly helpful for rapid prototyping, I've learned they can introduce bugs and suboptimal patterns. My strategy:

1. **Generate** - Use AI for initial code scaffolding
2. **Understand** - Ask AI to explain the code structure and design patterns
3. **Refine** - Debug, optimize, and adapt the code to best practices
4. **Learn** - Document what works, what doesn't, and why

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Frontend**: React/Vue.js with Monaco Editor
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express/Fastify
- **Real-time**: WebSockets (Socket.io)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MongoDB
- **DevOps**: Docker, CI/CD pipelines

## Current Status

This project is actively under development. Features are being added incrementally as I learn and grow.

## Personal Note

This isn't just about building another code editor - it's about the journey of learning, failing, debugging, and ultimately creating something meaningful. Every bug is a lesson, every refactor is growth.

*Hopefully, I will not give up on this one ;)*
